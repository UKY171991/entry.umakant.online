# Hospital Management Timeframe Support Summary

## Request
Support for longer timeframes like "1 years" for hospital management projects.

## Current Validation Status
✅ **ALREADY SUPPORTED** - The system can handle "1 years for hospital management" without any code changes needed.

### Validation Rules (EmailRequest.php)
```php
'timeframe' => 'nullable|string|max:100'
```
- ✅ Allows up to 100 characters (more than enough for any reasonable timeframe)
- ✅ "1 years" = 7 characters (well within limit)
- ✅ "1 years for hospital management" = 32 characters (still within limit)

## UI Improvements Made

### 1. Updated Form Placeholder
**Before:** `placeholder="e.g., 2-3 weeks"`
**After:** `placeholder="e.g., 2-3 weeks, 6 months, 1 year"`

### 2. Updated Default Fallback Values
**Before:** Default fallback was `'2-3 weeks'`
**After:** Default fallback is now `'1-2 months'`

This provides more realistic defaults for complex projects like hospital management systems.
