# Pending Tasks View Button and Edit Modal Fix - Implementation Summary

## âœ… Changes Successfully Implemented

### 1. Added View Button
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/PendingTaskController.php`
- Added a blue view button (eye icon) to the actions column in the DataTable
- Button appears before edit and delete buttons
- Uses `viewTask` class for JavaScript handling

**Code Added:**
```php
'action' => '<div class="btn-group" role="group">
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm viewTask" data-id="'.$task->id.'" title="View Task">
        <i class="fas fa-eye"></i>
    </button>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-info btn-sm editTask" data-id="'.$task->id.'" title="Edit Task">
        <i class="fas fa-edit"></i>
    </button>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-danger btn-sm deleteTask" data-id="'.$task->id.'" title="Delete Task">
        <i class="fas fa-trash"></i>
    </button>
</div>'
```

### 2. Created View Modal
**File:** `resources/views/pending-tasks/index.blade.php`
- Added a new modal with ID `viewModal` 
- Displays all task information in read-only format
- Shows formatted status and payment status with colored badges
- Displays task image if available, or shows "No image available"
- Clean, professional layout with proper icons

**Features:**
- Task name display
- Client name display
- Full description view
- Formatted due date
- Status with colored badges (Success/Warning/Info)
- Payment amount with rupee symbol
- Payment status with colored badges (Success/Danger)
- Image preview or "No image available" message

### 3. Fixed Edit Modal Data Loading
**Files:** `app/Http/Controllers/PendingTaskController.php`

**Updated Methods:**
- `edit()` method: Now includes client relationship using `with('client')`
- `show()` method: Now includes client relationship for view modal
- Both methods properly format dates and payment amounts

**Fixes Applied:**
```php
// In edit() method
$task = PendingTask::with('client')->find($id);

// In show() method  
$task = PendingTask::with('client')->find($id);
```

### 4. Added JavaScript Functionality
**File:** `resources/views/pending-tasks/index.blade.php`

**View Task JavaScript:**
- Handles click events on `.viewTask` buttons
- Makes AJAX call to `/pending-tasks/{id}` endpoint
- Populates view modal with formatted data
- Handles status and payment status badges
- Manages image display/fallback

**Key Features:**
- Proper error handling with toastr notifications
- Status badge formatting (Completed=green, Pending=yellow, In Progress=blue)
- Payment status badge formatting (Paid=green, Unpaid=red)
- Image handling with fallback for missing images
- Formatted currency display with rupee symbol
