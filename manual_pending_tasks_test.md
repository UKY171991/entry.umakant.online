# Manual Testing Guide for Pending Tasks View and Edit Modal

## Changes Made

### 1. Added View Button
- Added a view button (eye icon) to the actions column in the DataTable
- Button appears before the edit and delete buttons
- Uses `btn-primary` class with `viewTask` class for JavaScript handling

### 2. Created View Modal
- New modal with ID `viewModal` 
- Displays all task information in read-only format
- Shows formatted status and payment status with badges
- Displays task image if available
- Clean, professional layout with proper icons

### 3. Fixed Edit Modal Data Loading
- Updated `edit()` method in controller to include client relationship
- Updated `show()` method in controller to include client relationship
- Both methods now properly format dates and payment amounts

- Check if the show endpoint returns proper JSON

If edit modal data doesn't load:

- Verify the edit endpoint returns client relationship
- Check if date formatting is working

If buttons don't appear:
